				<h1>The Salon des Refus&#233;s, French for &#171;exhibition of rejects&#187;, is generally an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official Paris Salon, but the term is most famously used to refer to the Salon des Refus&#233;s of 1863.</h1>
				<h1>Today by extension, salon des refus&#233;s refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show.</h1>
